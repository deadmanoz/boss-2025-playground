# G'day ðŸ‘‹

These are the notes that I wrote along the way during the BOSS 2025 program. I had intended to write as I went, but I only ended up starting to write them upon completion of the signet wallet challenge, and then regularly along the way from that point forward.

## Style
These notes are perhaps slightly different from some of the excellent material that has been produced by previous program members or current cohort members in that they are less technical and maybe a bit more personal (checkout [participant content](../participant-content.md)). I find written content more engaging when it has a human-behind-the-writing element to it, so I am writing in this style here for this very reason - it is material that I would find most engaging.

## No Spoilers!

I endeavour to *NOT* provide any solutions or answers here so that future participants can benefit from putting in the work themselves! Feel the pain and work through the process of failing to sign a transaction many times before success like many of us did!

## About me

Late last year I suddenly realised I was burnout and needed to take a break. I had spent the previous almost 5 years as an engineering manager at an ML (start-again) startup. Doing lots of shallow work, sacrificing my attention to support the engineers, company and customers, reaching a learning a plateau and eventually hitting the burnout wall. Mid-life crisis?

Anyway, I heard about BOSS and thought that it would be a great way to get my mojo back. Get back on and learn new tools ðŸ¦€. Start to repair my fractured attention. Go deeper down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and make something of the experience. LFG ðŸš€

## Why I'm writing side note

Although it is true that we have been encouraged to "create a record" during the process for a variety of reasons, truth is I have wanted an excuse to start writing more regularly and more publicly. During my education, I transitioned from almost non-writer to actually enjoying the writing process and appreciating the "writing is thinking" philosophy. But then out in the working world, I gradually wrote less and less, until I was no longer writing at all. And then years passed.. but here we are, writing again.
