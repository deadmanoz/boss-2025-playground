### \#221 - Prevent Memory Buildup by Clearing Joinsets
https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln/pull/221

There's a specific branch to help illustrate the issue: https://github.com/carlaKC/sim-ln/tree/review-club-memleak.

We need to _"attach a heap allocation profiler and see the memory leak
in action, and identify the tasks that are building up memory."_

I'm on macOS so I'll need to use [cargo-instruments](https://github.com/cmyr/cargo-instruments) with XCode. Aside: It's been a long while since I've had to _myself_ run profilers and the like, going back maybe 6-7 years... the last time I had to use Windows! My most recent experience with such tools was been working with my previous engineering team using NVIDIA's NSys (Nsight Systems) for investigating issues and optimising video and machine learning processing pipelines.

```
cargo instruments --list-templates                             
Could not list templates. Please check your Xcode Instruments installation.
```

I have Xcode CLI tools already installed on macOS 14.7.1, but instruments doesn't appear to be available (supposed to be at `/usr/bin/instruments`). So I'll grab the main Xcode app - I'll need this to have a nice UI anyway.

Some reading material [Using Xcode Instruments for C++ CPU profiling](https://www.jviotti.com/2024/01/29/using-xcode-instruments-for-cpp-cpu-profiling.html).

Encountered an issue when a running, terminating (via ctrl-c) and then attempting to load the trace file in instruments. Thinking it might a template issue I tried both `alloc` and `Leaks` as below, but traces of neither could be loaded.

```bash
cargo instruments --bin sim-cli -t alloc -- -s simln.json
cargo instruments --bin sim-cli -t Leaks -- -s simln.json
```

Found a relevant issue on the cargo-instruments repo: https://github.com/cmyr/cargo-instruments/issues/41 and a comment provided the the solution: set a time limit, e.g. `--time-limit=N` (N in ms)
```bash
cargo instruments --bin sim-cli -t Leaks --time-limit 1000000 -- -s simln.json
```

Now we can create trace files that can be loaded into Instruments for analysis.

Here's a screenshot of the Instruments UI with one of the traces loaded (from `-t alloc` but it's similar for `-t Leaks`), showing the leak in `produce_simulation_results` relating to the `tokio::task::join_set`:

![instruments leak identified](./images/instruments-leak-identified.png)

So what's going on?

Tasks such as `produce_simulation_results` are spawned and added to the `tokio::task::JoinSet` in `run_data_collection` (the `tokio::task::JoinSet` is actually initialised in the `run` function).

`produce_simulation_results` itself creates a `tokio::task::JoinSet` (`set`), tasks are spawned and added to this `set` when there has been a successful payment sent. But the spawning and addition of tasks to this `set` happens within an (effectively) infinite loop, so the `set` continues to accumulate task and their results until the function exits.

The solution is to periodically clear out completed tasks from `set`. Carla Kirk-Cohen provides a potential solution on [her PR](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/sim-ln/pull/221):

```
// Do a best-effort attempt to clear out any completed tasks in the joinset before proceeding to process
// more results. This prevents the joinset from building up over time and never emptying out any completed
// tasks.
while let Some(res) = set.try_join_next() {
    if let Err(e) = res {
        log::error!("Error collecting joinset: {e}");
        break 'outer Err(SimulationError::TaskError);
    }
}
```

But the following questions are raised:
1) Jemalloc is often recommended when a rust program isnâ€™t freeing up memory nicely. With this fix, is this something Sim-LN should consider? Why or why not?
2) Given that joinset holds onto memory for the tasks it spawns, is it a good idea to have one single joinset in the SimGraph struct?
3) Do you have different suggestions for consuming the joinset in produce_simulation_results?

...

1) _"jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support"_. It's intended for scenarios where there are many small allocations and deallocations. With the fix, there are probably going to be lots of small allocations and deallocations, so jemalloc might be a good fit (and seems straightforward to integrate).
2) There's just the single joinset in the `SimGraph` struct and it's only used for `propagate_payment`. But a joinset is potentially unbounded, with tasks remaining in the set until they are removed (e.g. via `join_next`). I don't yet understand enough of the code to understand what might be a better alternative.
3) Somehow bounding the size of the joinset? But calling `try_join_next` every loop iteration seems like an acceptable solution, didn't yet run the code with this change to evaluate the impact.

These are unfortunately not really deeply considered answers, I look forward to hearing what other participants have to say ðŸ™‚

#### What are we simulating?
The `simln.json` file only contains a `sim_network`, no `nodes` or `activity`. So instead of explicitly specifying the nodes, the nodes in the network are inferred from the edges provided.

```
2025-03-07T14:07:25.973Z INFO  [simln_lib] Running the simulation forever.
2025-03-07T14:07:25.973Z INFO  [simln_lib] Simulation is running on regtest.
2025-03-07T14:07:25.973Z INFO  [simln_lib] Simulating 0 activity on 67 nodes.
2025-03-07T14:07:25.974Z INFO  [simln_lib] Summary of results will be reported every 60s.
2025-03-07T14:07:25.975Z INFO  [simln_lib] Created network generator: network graph view with: 67 channels.
```

As the comments above `new_with_sim_network` in `simln-lib/src/lib.rs` indicate, this is a
> "payment simulation that's running on a simulated set of channels. As this simulation has no underlying nodes it can optionally be sped up by some multiplying factor."

And when no activity description is specified by the user, as in this case, random activity is generated (`validate_activity` in `simln-lib/src/lib.rs`).
