# Lightning Builders
In the same vein as the [Block Builder challenge](./3-block-builder.md), I won't go into too much detail here so as to give future participants the opportunity to read, understand, struggle, solve and ENJOY the challenge. Suffice to say, there were 2 challenges that were about understanding and building fundamental functionality of a Lightning node, and there are some gnarly concepts or aspects that tripped many participants up.
