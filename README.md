# boss-2025-playground

This is my playground for the BOSS 2025 program. I'm using this repo to record my progress and learnings as I progress, and as a forcing function to stay the course and see it through.

I'll be writing notes in the `notes` section and will add random off-piste code snippets in some other, TBD, section(s).
