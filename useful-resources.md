# Useful resources

We're fortunate in early 2025 to have so much amazing content available to learn from. Here's a list of some of the resources that myself and others have found useful.

## Learn me a Bitcoin
Top of the list because it is an incredible resource that is pretty much a one-stop shop for getting started on the Bitcoin technical track. It also looks as though the author Greg Walker has recently revamped the site, or has been cranking out content; most of the pages were last updated in December 2024/January 2025.

## The Bitcoin Dev Project's Decoding Bitcoin
Another incredible visualisation-heavy resource that I've found really useful. It even has a bunch of mini-exercises you can work through in sandboxed environments to test your understanding via JavaScript or Python implementation. It has a neat feature in that you can track your progress through the material by marking pages "as Complete". The content is all openly available on GitHub, so you can participate in suggesting changes to the content.

## Elle Mouton's blog
Some great information and illustrations on the Lightning Network and the mechanics of channels and HTLCs. In particular:
- The 5 post series on "LN Things" is a good starting point - [LN Things Part 1: Creating a channel](https://ellemouton.com/posts/creating-a-channel/).
- The 2 posts on Lightning Network Onion Routing are excellent - [Lightning Network Onion Routing: Preliminaries](https://ellemouton.com/posts/onion-routing-prelims/).

## Bitcoin Optech
Straight from the horse's mouth:
> _"provide(s) workshops, weekly newsletters, case studies and announcements, analysis of Bitcoin software and services, a podcast, and help facilitate improved relations between businesses and the open source community."_

Lots of articles explaining various concepts or terminology and a chronological perspective of what is being discussed or worked on, by and large, by the Bitcoin ecosystem at any given time (going back years). I finally understand enough to be able to read (or listen to the Podcast recap) the weekly newsletter after having participated in ₿OSS 2025!
